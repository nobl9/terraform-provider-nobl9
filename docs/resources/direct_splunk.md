# nobl9_direct_splunk (Resource)

Splunk provides software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data via a Web-style interface. Nobl9 connects with Splunk to collect SLI measurements and compare them to SLO targets.

For more information, refer to [Splunk Direct | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Sources/splunk#splunk-direct).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "nobl9_direct_splunk" "test-splunk" {
  name         = "test-splunk"
  project      = "terraform"
  description  = "desc"
  source_of    = ["Metrics", "Services"]
  url          = "https://web.net"
  access_token = "secret"
  log_collection_enabled = true
  historical_data_retrieval {
    default_duration {
      unit  = "Day"
      value = 0
    }
    max_duration {
      unit  = "Day"
      value = 30
    }
  }
}
