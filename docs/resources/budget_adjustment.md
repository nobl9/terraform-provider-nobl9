# nobl9_budget_adjustment (Resource)

The budget adjustment feature allows you to define future periods where planned maintenance, releases, and similar activities won't affect your budget in specific SLOs.

For more details, refer to the [Budget adjustment configuration documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#budget-adjustment).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Budget Adjustment resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_budget_adjustment" "single-budget-adjustment-event" {
  name              = "single-budget-adjustment-event"
  display_name      = "Single Budget Adjustment Event"
  first_event_start = "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  duration          = "1h"
  description       = "Single budget adjustment event"
  filters {
    slos {
      slo {
        name    = "my-slo"
        project = "default"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "nobl9_budget_adjustment" "recurring-budget-adjustment-event" {
  name              = "recurring-budget-adjustment-event"
  display_name      = "Recurring Budget Adjustment Event"
  first_event_start = "2022-01-01T16:00:00Z"
  duration          = "1h"
  rrule             = "FREQ=WEEKLY"
  description       = "Recurring budget adjustment event"
  filters {
    slos {
      slo {
        name    = "my-slo"
        project = "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
