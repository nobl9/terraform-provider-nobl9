Pingdom is a website monitoring software solution that gives users real-time, quality insights into the uptime and performance of their websites. After adding Pingdom as a data source in Nobl9, users can configure SLOs to check the overall performance status of their sites. Nobl9 connects to Pingdom for SLI measurement collection and comparison with SLO targets.
