# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

The **Slack Alert Method** allows sending a predefined notification through Slack to notify Nobl9 users whenever an incident is triggered.

-> **NOTE** To set up the Slack integration, you'll need to provide an Incoming Webhook URL. This allows Slack to send an automated notification to a channel of your choice. For details, see the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#enable_webhooks).

For more details, refer to {{ .Description | trimspace }}.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Slack Terraform resource configuration:

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
