# nobl9_service (Data Source)

A **service** in Nobl9 is a high-level grouping of Service Level Objectives (SLOs). A service can represent a logical service endpoint like an API, a database, an application, or anything else you care about setting an SLO for. Every SLO in Nobl9 is tied to a service, and the service can have one or more SLOs.

For more details, refer to the [Service configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#service).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Service Data Source configuration:

```terraform
