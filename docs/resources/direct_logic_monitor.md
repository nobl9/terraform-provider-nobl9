# nobl9_direct_logic_monitor (Resource)

LogicMonitor is a SaaS-based monitoring platform designed for automated monitoring of IT systems. It centralizes monitoring by providing a unified view of various IT components, including networks, cloud environments, servers, and applications. Nobl9 integration with LogicMonitor allows you to create SLOs on LogicMonitor DataPoints based on a threshold (raw) or ratio (count) metrics.

For more information, refer to [Logic Monitor Direct | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Sources/logic-monitor#logic-monitor-direct)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "nobl9_direct_logic_monitor" "logic_monitor" {
  name = "logic-monitor"
  project = "logic-monitor"
  description = "desc"
  account = "account_name"
  account_id = "secret"
  access_key = "secret"
  log_collection_enabled = true
  release_channel = "beta"
  query_delay {
    unit = "Minute"
    value = 6
  }
}
```
