# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Lightstep is an observability platform that enables distributed tracing, that can be used to rapidly pinpoint the causes of failures and poor performance across the deeply complex dependencies among services, teams, and workloads in modern production systems. Nobl9 integration with Lightstep enables organizations to establish service level objectives from performance data captured through distributed traces in the Lightstep platform. Nobl9 connects to Lightstep for SLI measurement collection and comparison with SLO targets.
