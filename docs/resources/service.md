# nobl9_service (Resource)

A **service** in Nobl9 is a high-level grouping of Service Level Objectives (SLOs). A service can represent a logical service endpoint like an API, a database, an application, or anything else you care about setting an SLO for. Every SLO in Nobl9 is tied to a service, and the service can have one or more SLOs.

For more details, refer to the [Service configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#service).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Service resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_project" "this" {
  display_name = "My Project"
  name         = "my-project"
  description  = "An example N9 Terraform project"
}

resource "nobl9_service" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-front-page"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Front Page"
  description  = "Front page service"

  label {
    key    = "env"
    values = ["dev", "prod"]
  }

  label {
    key    = "team"
    values = ["red"]
  }
}
```
