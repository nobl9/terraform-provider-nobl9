# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Nobl9 supports **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enable granular user permissions and access to resources in the Nobl9 platform.

There are two levels of permissions, the organization level and the project level:

- **Organization** roles enable access across the Nobl9 platform.

- **Project** roles enable users to access a project and its underlying resources, such as services or SLOs.

For more details, refer to the {{ .Description | trimspace }}.

-> **NOTE** To configure RBAC through Terraform, you must provide `role_ref` and either `account_id` or `user` values:

- `account_id` is an Account ID. You can retrieve it from **Settings** > **Users** from User ID or **Settings** > **API Keys** from Client ID in the Nobl9 UI. This is the preferred field.

- `user` is deprecated in favor of `account_id`. While still supported for backward compatibility, new configurations should use `account_id`.

- `role_ref` must be an existing role name that you want the user to assume. If you don't specify the optional `project_ref` value, `role_ref` must contain an Organization Role.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of RBAC resource configuration:

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}
