# nobl9_alert_method_servicenow (Resource)

The **ServiceNow Alert Method** automatically opens an issue in your ServiceNow workflow to notify you whenever an incident is triggered.

-> **NOTE** To allow ServiceNow alerts to integrate with Nobl9, you need to set up an Access Control List (ACL) for your ServiceNow users. Refer to [Nobl9 documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/alerting/alert-methods/servicenow) for more details.

For more details, refer to [ServiceNow Alert Method | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/alerting/alert-methods/servicenow).
