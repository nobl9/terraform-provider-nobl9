# nobl9_direct_splunk_observability (Resource)

Splunk Observability allows users to search, monitor, and analyze machine-generated big data. Splunk Observability enables collecting and monitoring metrics, logs, and traces from common data sources. Data collection and monitoring in one place enables full-stack, end-to-end observability of the entire infrastructure. Nobl9 connects with Splunk Observability to collect SLI measurements and compare them to SLO targets.
