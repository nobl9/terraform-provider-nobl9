Google Cloud Monitoring (GCM) provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. It collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, hosted uptime probes, and application instrumentation. Nobl9 connects with GCM to collect SLI measurements and compare them to SLO targets.
