# nobl9_project (Resource)

**Projects** are the primary logical grouping of resources in the Nobl9 platform. All Nobl9 resources, such as data sources, SLOs, and alerts, are created within a project.

Access controls at the project level enable users to control who can see and change these resources. For example, you can allow all of your users to view the SLOs in a given project, but only a few users to make changes.

For more details, refer to [Project configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#project).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Project resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_project" "this" {
  display_name = "My Project"
  name         = "my-project"
  description  = "An example N9 Terraform project"

  label {
    key    = "env"
    values = ["dev", "prod"]
  }

  label {
    key    = "team"
    values = ["red"]
  }
}
```
