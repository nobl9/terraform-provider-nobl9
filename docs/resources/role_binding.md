# nobl9_role_binding (Resource)

Nobl9 supports **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enable granular user permissions and access to resources in the Nobl9 platform.

There are two levels of permissions, the organization level and the project level:

- **Organization** roles enable access across the Nobl9 platform.

- **Project** roles enable users to access a project and its underlying resources, such as services or SLOs.

For more details, refer to the [Role Binding configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#rolebinding).

-> **NOTE** To configure RBAC through Terraform, you must provide `role_ref` and `user` values:

- `user` is a User ID from Okta. You can retrieve it from **Settings** > **Account and Settings** > **Users** in the Nobl9 UI.

- `role_ref` must be an existing role name that you want the user to assume. If you don't specify the optional `project_ref` value, `role_ref` must contain an Organization Role.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of RBAC resource configuration using the preferred `account_id` field:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_role_binding" "this" {
  name        = "my-role-binding"
  account_id  = "00udujwksdl5sTDtu4x7"
  role_ref    = "project-owner"
  project_ref = "default"
}

resource "nobl9_role_binding" "this" {
  name        = "group-role-binding"
  group_ref   = "test"
  role_ref    = "project-owner"
  project_ref = "default"
}
```

**Deprecated example** (backward compatibility):

```terraform
resource "nobl9_role_binding" "legacy" {
  name        = "legacy-role-binding"
  user        = "00udujwksdl5sTDtu4x7"  # Deprecated: use account_id instead
  role_ref    = "project-owner"
  project_ref = "default"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `role_ref` (String) Role name; the role that you want the user or group to assume.

### Optional

- `account_id` (String) Account ID (Okta User ID) that can be retrieved from the Nobl9 UI (**Settings** > **Users**). This is the preferred field for specifying user accounts.
- `display_name` (String) User-friendly display name of the resource.
- `group_ref` (String) Group name that can be retrieved from the Nobl9 UI (**Settings** > **Groups**) or using sloctl `get usergroups` command.
- `name` (String) Automatically generated, unique name of the resource, must conform to the naming convention from [DNS RFC1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).
- `project_ref` (String) Project name, the project in which we want the user or group to assume the specified role. When `project_ref` is empty, `role_ref` must contain an Organization Role.
- `user` (String, Deprecated) Okta User ID that can be retrieved from the Nobl9 UI (**Settings** > **Users**). **Deprecated:** Use `account_id` instead. This field will be removed in a future.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
