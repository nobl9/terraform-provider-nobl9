# nobl9_direct_pingdom (Resource)

Pingdom is a website monitoring software solution that gives users real-time, quality insights into the uptime and performance of their websites. After adding Pingdom as a data source in Nobl9, users can configure SLOs to check the overall performance status of their sites. Nobl9 connects with Pingdom to collect SLI measurements and compare them to SLO targets.

For more information, refer to [Pingdom Direct | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Sources/pingdom#pingdom-direct).
