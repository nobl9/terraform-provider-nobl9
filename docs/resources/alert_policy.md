# nobl9_alert_policy (Resource)

An **Alert Policy** expresses a set of conditions you want to track or monitor. The conditions for an Alert Policy define what is monitored and when to activate an alert: when the performance of your service is declining, Nobl9 will send a notification to a predefined channel.

A Nobl9 AlertPolicy accepts up to 7 conditions. All the specified conditions must be satisfied to trigger an alert.

For more details, refer to the [Alert Policy configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#alertpolicy).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Alert Policy resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_project" "this" {
  display_name = "My Project"
  name         = "my-project"
  description  = "An example N9 Terraform project"
}

resource "nobl9_service" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-front-page"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Front Page"
  description  = "Front page service"
}

resource "nobl9_alert_policy" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-front-page-latency"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Front Page Latency"
  severity     = "High"
  description  = "Alert when page latency is > 2000 and error budget would be exhausted"

  condition {
    measurement  = "timeToBurnBudget"
    value_string = "72h"
    lasts_for    = "30m"
  }

  alert_method {
    name = "my-alert-method"
  }
}
```

- `display_name` (String) User-friendly display name of the resource.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--condition"></a>
### Nested Schema for `condition`

Required:

- `measurement` (String) One of `timeToBurnBudget` | `burnRate` | `burnedBudget`.

Optional:

- `lasts_for` (String) Indicates how long a given condition needs to be valid to mark the condition as true.
- `value` (Number) For `averageBurnRate`, it indicates how fast the error budget is burning. For `burnedBudget`, it tells how much error budget is already burned.
- `value_string` (String) Used with `timeToBurnBudget`, indicates when the budget would be exhausted. The expected value is a string in time duration string format.


<a id="nestedblock--alert_method"></a>
### Nested Schema for `alert_method`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the previously defined alert method.

Optional:

- `project` (String) Project name the Alert Method is in, convention for naming object from [DNS RFC1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names). If not defined, Nobl9 returns a default value for this field.
