# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Nobl9 supports **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enable granular user permissions and access to resources in the Nobl9 platform.

There are two levels of permissions, the organization level and the project level:

- **Organization** roles enable access across the Nobl9 platform.

- **Project** roles enable users to access a project and its underlying resources, such as services or SLOs.

For more details, refer to the {{ .Description | trimspace }}.

-> **NOTE** To configure RBAC through Terraform, you must provide role_ref and user values:

- user is a User ID from Okta. You can retrieve it from Settings > Account and Settings > Users in the Nobl9 UI.

- role_ref must be an existing role name that we want the user to assume. If you don't specify the project_ref value, role_ref has to contain an Organization Role.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of RBAC resource configuration:

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
