# nobl9_alert_policy (Resource)

An **Alert Policy** expresses a set of conditions you want to track or monitor. The conditions for an Alert Policy define what is monitored and when to activate an alert: when the performance of your service is declining, Nobl9 will send a notification to a predefined channel.

A Nobl9 AlertPolicy accepts up to 3 conditions. All the specified conditions must be satisfied to trigger an alert.

For more details, refer to the [Alert Policy configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#alertpolicy).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of Alert Policy resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_project" "this" {
  display_name = "My Project"
  name         = "my-project"
  description  = "An example N9 Terraform project"
}

resource "nobl9_service" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-front-page"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Front Page"
  description  = "Front page service"
}

resource "nobl9_alert_policy" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-front-page-latency"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Front Page Latency"
  severity     = "High"
  description  = "Alert when page latency is > 2000 and error budget would be exhausted"

  condition {
    measurement  = "timeToBurnBudget"
    value_string = "72h"
    lasts_for    = "30m"
  }

  alert_method {
    name = "my-alert-method"
  }
}

resource "nobl9_alert_policy" "this" {
  name         = "${nobl9_project.this.name}-slow-burn"
  project      = nobl9_project.this.name
  display_name = "${nobl9_project.this.display_name} Slow burn (1x12h and 2x15min)"
  severity     = "Low"
  description  = "The budget is slowly exhausting and not recovering."

  condition {
    measurement  = "averageBurnRate"
    value = "1"
    alerting_window    = "12h"
  }

  condition {
    measurement  = "averageBurnRate"
    value = "2"
    alerting_window    = "15m"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `condition` (Block List, Min: 1) Configuration of an [alert condition](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide/#alertpolicy). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--condition))
- `name` (String) Unique name of the resource, must conform to the naming convention from [DNS RFC1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).
- `project` (String) Name of the Nobl9 project the resource sits in, must conform to the naming convention from [DNS RFC1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).
- `severity` (String) Alert severity. One of `Low` | `Medium` | `High`.

### Optional

- `alert_method` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--alert_method))
- `description` (String) Optional description of the resource. Here, you can add details about who is responsible for the integration (team/owner) or the purpose of creating it.
- `display_name` (String) User-friendly display name of the resource.
- `cool_down` (String) An interval measured from the last time stamp when all alert policy conditions were satisfied before alert is marked as resolved.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--condition"></a>
### Nested Schema for `condition`

Required:

- `measurement` (String) One of `timeToBurnBudget` | `timeToBurnEntireBudget` | `burnRate` | `burnedBudget`.

Optional:

- `lasts_for` (String) Indicates how long a given condition needs to be valid to mark the condition as true.
- `value` (Number) For `averageBurnRate`, it indicates how fast the error budget is burning. For `burnedBudget`, it tells how much error budget is already burned.
- `value_string` (String) Used with `timeToBurnBudget` or `timeToBurnEntireBudget`, indicates when the budget would be exhausted. The expected value is a string in time duration string format.
- `alerting_window` (String) Duration over which the burn rate is evaluated.


<a id="nestedblock--alert_method"></a>
### Nested Schema for `alert_method`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the previously defined alert method.

Optional:

- `project` (String) Project name the Alert Method is in, must conform to the naming convention from [DNS RFC1123](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names). If not defined, Nobl9 returns a default value for this field.
