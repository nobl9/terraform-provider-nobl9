# nobl9_direct_dynatrace (Resource)

Dynatrace is a software intelligence platform that monitors and optimizes application performance, development and security, IT infrastructure, and user experience. The Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform maps, and monitors applications, microservices, container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, and IT infrastructure running in multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments, and provides automated problem remediation. Nobl9 connects with Dynatrace to collect SLI measurements and compare them to SLO targets.
