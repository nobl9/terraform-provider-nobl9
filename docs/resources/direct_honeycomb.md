# nobl9_direct_honeycomb (Resource)

Honeycomb is an observability platform that integrates system metrics with high-cardinality application data for in-depth analysis and swift debugging of complex software systems. Nobl9 connects to Honeycomb for SLI measurement collection and comparison with SLO targets.

For more information, refer to [Honeycomb Direct | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Sources/honeycomb#hc-direct).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "nobl9_direct_honeycomb" "test-honeycomb" {
  name = "test-honeycomb"
  project = "terraform"
  description = "desc"
  api_key = "secret"
  log_collection_enabled = true
  release_channel = "beta"
  historical_data_retrieval {
    default_duration  {
      unit = "Day"
      value = 7
    }
    max_duration {
      unit = "Day"
      value = 7
    }
  }
  query_delay {
    unit = "Minute"
    value = 6
  }
}
```
