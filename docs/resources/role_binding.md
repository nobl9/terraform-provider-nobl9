# nobl9_role_binding (Resource)

Nobl9 supports **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enable granular user permissions and access to resources in the Nobl9 platform.

There are two levels of permissions, the organization level and the project level:

- **Organization** roles enable access across the Nobl9 platform.

- **Project** roles enable users to access a project and its underlying resources, such as services or SLOs.

For more details, refer to the [Role Binding configuration | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/yaml-guide#rolebinding).

-> **NOTE** To configure RBAC through Terraform, you must provide `role_ref` and either `user` or `group_ref` values:

- `user` is a User ID from Okta. You can retrieve it from **Settings** > **Access Controls** > **Users** in the Nobl9 UI.

- `group_ref` is a Group name. You can retrieve it from **Settings** > **Access Controls** > **Groups** in the Nobl9 UI or using sloctl `get usergroups` command.

- `role_ref` must be an existing role name that you want the user to assume. If you don't specify the optional `project_ref` value, `role_ref` must contain an Organization Role.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of RBAC resource configuration:

```terraform
resource "nobl9_role_binding" "this" {
  name        = "my-role-binding"
  user        = "1234567890asdfghjkl"
  role_ref    = "project-owner"
  project_ref = "1234567890asdfghjkl"
}
```
