# nobl9_direct_gcm (Resource)

Google Cloud Monitoring (GCM) provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. It collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, hosted uptime probes, and application instrumentation. Nobl9 connects to GCM for SLI measurement collection and comparison with SLO targets.

For more information, refer to [Google Cloud Monitoring Direct | Nobl9 Documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Sources/google-cloud-monitoring#google-cloud-monitoring-direct).
