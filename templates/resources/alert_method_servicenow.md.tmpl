# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

The **ServiceNow Alert Method** automatically opens an issue in your ServiceNow workflow to notify you whenever an incident is triggered.

-> **NOTE** To allow ServiceNow alerts to integrate with Nobl9, you need to set up an Access Control List (ACL) for your ServiceNow users. Refer to [Nobl9 documentation](https://docs.nobl9.com/Alerting/servicenow) for more details.

For more details, refer to {{ .Description | trimspace }}.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of ServiceNow Terraform resource configuration:

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
